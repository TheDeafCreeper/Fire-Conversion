# Materials use their name found @ https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.19/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Usually, it's just ITEM_ID, however if that does not work you can look it up at the linked page.
# DO NOT USE LEGACY_MATERIAL

# Example Conversion:
#  SimpleConversion:
#   sources:
#     - MATERIAL_1
#     - MATERIAL_2
#   result:
#     normal: RESULT_NORMAL
#     soul: NONE

# If you want to change the amount/weight of a material you can add -AMOUNT-WEIGHT (including the dashes), you can also add multiple results using this system.
# Not proving values for weight/amount defaults them to 1.

#  ComplexConversion:
#   sources:
#     - MATERIAL_1
#     - MATERIAL_2
#   result:
#     normal:
#       - RESULT_ONE-1-10 # This would have a 71.4% chance of dropping 1
#       - RESULT_TWO-2-3 # 21.4% chance of dropping 2
#       - RESULT_THREE-3-1 # and 7.1% chance of dropping 3
#     soul:
#       - RESULT_ONE

# You can figure out the percentage from the weight using the formula WEIGHT/TOTAL_WEIGHTS
